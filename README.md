# sphinx-conditional-project
A Sphinx Doc Project with conditional tags

You can run:

```
$ make devel
```

And a `build/devel/html` build dir should be produced.  Likewise, running: 

```
$ make interop
```

Will produce a `build/devel/html`.  Finally, by running:

```
$ make full
```

You'll get a `build/full/html` containing both devel and interop sections.
